### exif sample images
This repo has a lot of good sample images:  https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples/tree/master/jpg

### img_natron.jpg
Natron saved this 3x3 image very oddly and distorted the resolution.
However, it is the only software that I was able to get a pixel aspect ratio of 2.0.
Nuke and Photoshop both save JPEGs at a 1.0 PAR regardless of the project's true resolution.
